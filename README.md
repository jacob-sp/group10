Landslide Susceptibility Map 
GIS Project 2024
Welcome to Group 10's project repository! We've worked on creating maps to show areas prone to landslides and the people living there.

What We Did:
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: We made maps that highlight areas more likely to have landslides based on factors like terrain and rainfall.
Population Exposure Assessment: We looked at where people live in relation to these landslide-prone areas to understand who might be at risk.

How You Can Help:
